This code is the Distributed Memory implementation of BlackScholes Option Pricing Formula Calculation from popular PARSEC Multithreaded Benchmark. I used serial and multithreaded code of PARSEC benchmark and further extended it to add support for Message Passing Interface. Due to the data parallel nature of the problem, I used Option wide domain decomposition.
